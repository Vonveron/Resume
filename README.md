This project is a lightweight SwiftUI Weather App designed to demonstrate practical iOS engineering skills using real-world patterns. It features live weather data pulled from a REST API, async/await networking, and reliable JSON decoding. The interface shown in the screenshots highlights a responsive, Apple-style UI, built with SwiftUI’s layout system, view composition, and data-driven rendering.

The app emphasizes clean, scalable development practices, including state management with @State and @Observable, modular code organization, and reusable UI components. This project showcases core competencies essential for modern iOS roles: Swift proficiency, API integration, debugging, performance awareness, and production-ready UI implementation.

Developed strong SwiftUI fundamentals by building daily interactive
components using VStack, LazyVGrid, List, NavigationStack, and state
management with @State and @AppStorage. Gained hands-on experience
implementing dynamic UI updates, user input handling, grid layouts, card
interfaces, and animated transitions with withAnimation. Strengthened
practical Swift skills through creating functional mini-apps including a to-
do list, color grid explorer, weather card, stopwatch, habit tracker, and
random content generator—optimized for modern iOS development
workflows.
