# Parrié Vonverons Resume Of Ongoing Swift UI / iOS Projects

# About Me

My name is Parrié Vonveorn. I've been learning and developing apps on the apple ecosystem since 2022. I completed my first Demo App in 2022 using older UIkit arictechture and learned the basics of Swift UI in 2023. Since then I've been steadily growing my skills and have the two following projects as demonstartions of my skills. 


# Weather App: Completed
A Basic weather app demo I've followed to establish core fundamentals of Swift.

This project is a lightweight SwiftUI Weather App designed to demonstrate practical iOS engineering skills using real-world patterns. It features live weather data pulled from a REST API, async/await networking, and reliable JSON decoding. The interface shown in the screenshots highlights a responsive, Apple-style UI, built with SwiftUI’s layout system, view composition, and data-driven rendering.

The app emphasizes clean, scalable development practices, including state management with @State and @Observable, modular code organization, and reusable UI components. This project showcases core competencies essential for modern iOS roles: Swift proficiency, API integration, debugging, performance awareness, and production-ready UI implementation.

Developed strong SwiftUI fundamentals by building daily interactive
components using VStack, LazyVGrid, List, NavigationStack, and state
management with @State and @AppStorage. Gained hands-on experience
implementing dynamic UI updates, user input handling, grid layouts, card
interfaces, and animated transitions with withAnimation. Strengthened
practical Swift skills through creating functional mini-apps including a to-
do list, color grid explorer, weather card, stopwatch, habit tracker, and
random content generator—optimized for modern iOS development
workflows.
