This project is a lightweight SwiftUI Weather App designed to demonstrate practical iOS engineering skills using real-world patterns. It features live weather data pulled from a REST API, async/await networking, and reliable JSON decoding. The interface shown in the screenshots highlights a responsive, Apple-style UI, built with SwiftUI’s layout system, view composition, and data-driven rendering.

The app emphasizes clean, scalable development practices, including state management with @State and @Observable, modular code organization, and reusable UI components. This project showcases core competencies essential for modern iOS roles: Swift proficiency, API integration, debugging, performance awareness, and production-ready UI implementation.
